= profile-updater

*profile-updater* is a simple bot.
It's designed to automatically update your Twitter profile using a predefined schedule.

This bot was created to automate an idea I got from https://twitter.com/dkundel[@dkundel]: adding a suffix on your Twitter profile name when you speak at conference.
Something like this: "John SMITH ðŸ—£ AwesomeConf2018".

== How to run it?

Set the environment variables and run the bot with:

```
node src/profile-updater.js
```

The script is designed to run only once but you should run it periodically with cron (or something else).

NOTE: If you want to deploy this bot on Clever Cloud, there's already a `clevercloud/cron.json` file where you can tune the periodicity.

=== Environment variables

==== `DATASOURCE`

Each time the bot is running, it fetches a JSON file to get the different scheduled profile updates.
This `DATASOURCE` variable is used to specify the URL to the JSON file.
This file must be publicly accessible on the Web.
One good and simple solution for is to use a private GitHub gist.

Example: `https://gist.github.com/jsmith/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef/raw/profile-updater.json`

Here's an example of this JSON file:

```json
{
    "defaultTimezone": "Europe/Paris",
    "defaultProfile": {
        "name": "John SMITH"
    },
    "scheduledProfiles": [
        {
            "from": "2018-03-01 07:00",
            "to": "2018-03-03 20:59",
            "profile": {
                "name": "John SMITH ðŸ—£ AwesomeConf2018"
            }
        },
        {
            "from": "2018-05-20 08:00",
            "to": "2018-02-21 19:59",
            "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo",
            "profile": {
                "name": "John SMITH ðŸ—£ NotSoBadConf2018",
                "location": "Tokyo, Japan"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

* By default, the bot will use the `defaultTimezone` but you set a specific `timezone` for each scheduled profile.
* `from` and `to` follow this format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` but you can be less specific. +
Here are some valid examples.
** `"from": "2018-03-04 22:51:12"`
** `"from": "2018-03-04 22"` (will be the same as "2018-03-04 22:00:00")
** `"from": "2018-03"` (will be the same as "2018-03-01 00:00:00")
* The profile object will be directly posted to the Twitter API so you can specify all the params it accepts. +

[NOTE]
This BOT does not schedule the profile updates at the very specific datetimes you set.
It just checks if the current datetime matches one (and only one) of your scheduled profiles.
*You* are responsible to call this bot as frequently as you want it to be accurate.
